[scrypt-contrcats](https://github.com/satyasai69/BitFarm-contracts)

A decentralized farming protocol built on Bitcoin Ordinals, enabling users to farm and earn yields through Bitcoin inscriptions.

## Overview

BTCOrdinals Farms is a pioneering DeFi protocol that brings yield farming to Bitcoin through Ordinals technology. The protocol allows users to stake their inscriptions, participate in farming pools, and earn rewards in a completely decentralized manner on Bitcoin.
