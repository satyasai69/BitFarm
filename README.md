# BTC  Farms (FBTC)


[scrypt-contrcats](https://github.com/satyasai69/BitFarm-contracts)

A decentralized farming protocol built on Bitcoin Ordinals, enabling users to farm and earn yields through Bitcoin inscriptions.

## Overview

BTCOrdinals Farms is a pioneering DeFi protocol that brings yield farming to Bitcoin through Ordinals technology. The protocol allows users to stake their inscriptions, participate in farming pools, and earn rewards in a completely decentralized manner on Bitcoin.

## Protocol Architecture


## Farming Mechanics

### Land System

- Each land NFT (CAT-721) has unique properties:
  - Soil Quality (affects crop growth speed)
  - Water Access (determines irrigation needs)
  - Climate Zone (influences suitable crops)
  - Size (determines planting capacity)

### Crop Management

1. Planting

   - Different seed types for various crops
   - Seasonal planting restrictions
   - Soil preparation requirements

2. Growing

   - Growth stages (seedling, mature, harvest-ready)
   - Weather effects on growth
   - Disease and pest management
   - Watering and fertilizing mechanics

3. Harvesting
   - Optimal harvest timing
   - Crop quality factors
   - Harvest tool requirements
   - Yield calculations

### Resource Management

- Tools and Equipment

  - Basic tools (hoe, watering can, etc.)
  - Advanced machinery (tractors, harvesters)
  - Tool durability and maintenance

- Resources
  - Seeds
  - Water
  - Fertilizers
  - Energy points

### Reward System

- Daily farming tasks rewards
- Harvest quality bonuses
- Special event multipliers
- Community farming benefits

## Smart Contract System

### Farming Contract
```typescript
// Core functionalities
- stakeInscription(): Stake ordinal inscriptions
- unstakeInscription(): Withdraw staked inscriptions
